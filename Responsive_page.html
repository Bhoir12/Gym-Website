                                Boxing is a high-intensity workout that builds strength, fitness, and coordination. It's
                                also a great calorie burner, burning about 324 calories in 30 minutes. Boxing is
                                primarily a cardio exercise, but it also strengthens the muscles in the core and lower
                                body.
